# BiRRT_openrave
The final project of UMich EECS 498  
Need to install openrave to run the simulation.  
This project doesn't need any extra package except openrave, I write most things from scratch all by myself.  
So just run demo.py and follow the instruction, you'll see the planner searching in the environment and the robot finally executing the trajectory and reaching the goal.
